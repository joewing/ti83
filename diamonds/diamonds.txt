>Requirements
This game requires a TI-83 or a TI-83 Plus with Ion.

>Installation
For a TI-83: Send diamonds.83g to your calculator.
For a TI-83 Plus: Send diamonds.8xg to your calculator.

>Description
Diamonds is a Breakout-type game with a twist.  Instead
of moving a paddle to prevent the ball from hitting the
ground, you move the ball, which moves vertically, right
and left to get certain diamonds.

>Object
The object of the game is to get all the diamonds in as
little time as possible.  There is a ticking bonus.
Therefore the faster you get the diamonds, the higher
your score will be.

>Descriptions of the Blocks
The blocks with a cross in them kill you.  The blocks
that are half black and then have a pattern change the
type of diamond you can get to that pattern.  The diamonds
with the thin border you must get first or loss a life to
get.  The diamonds with the thick border you must get last.
The mostly black blocks with the six dots do not do
anything except stop the ball from going in that direction.
The block with the two little arrows switches the direction
that the arrow keys move the ball.  Lastly, there are lock
and key blocks.  You must get the key before you can get
the lock (you can only have one key at a time).

>Keys
Use right and left arrow keys to move and [CLEAR] to
start a level over (this takes away a life).
To pause a game press [MODE] and [ON] to continue.
To quit a game press [DEL].
There are menus for the rest
