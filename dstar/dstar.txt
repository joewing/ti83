>This programs requires ION v1.4+ to run!

>The ION Port was made by Jason Kovacs (Jason_K@calc.org).

>To install (assuming you already have ION):
If you have a TI-83, send DStar.83p to your calculator,
but for the TI-83+, send DStar.8xp. The extenstion to
these files is important for which one you should send.

>The object of the game is to move the dark ball around and
get the white balls, but you must move all the way to the
next wall with every move.  You may use the [2nd] key to
swap the box and the dark ball.

>To play, just use the arrow keys, [2nd] to swap the
dark box and ball, [ALPHA] to restart a level, and
[DEL] to quit.  [TRACE] saves a game and [GRAPH] loads
a game.
