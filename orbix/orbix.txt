>Description
Orbix is a game very similar to Othello I'm told (I've never played
Othello). I got the idea from the TI-86 version of Orbix. I did
change a few things though, such as the scoring. Anyway, if
you're not familiar with either: Orbix is a puzzle game where you try
to fill up the screen with your pieces. However, you have an opponent
(the calculator takes this role) that is trying to do the same. You
can only place one of your pieces next to another one of your own
pieces, or next to a calculator's piece if it, or another one of the
calculator's pieces, is touching one of your pieces in the same
direction. You can only move horizontally or vertically. You can only
take empty spaces, however, if you jump one or more of the calculator's
pieces, those will become your pieces. You always start the game taking
the black pieces (the calculator uses the white pieces). If you are the
calculator can not make a legal move, the other player must move until
the game is over or a move becomes possible.
