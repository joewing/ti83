zmPW v2.1 by Joe Wingbermuehle 20000105

>Requirements
A TI-83 or a TI-83 Plus with Ion.

>Installation
TI-83:		Send zmpw.83g to your calculator.
TI-83 Plus: 	Send zmpw.8xg to your calculator.

>Description
zmPW is an Ion module that provides powerful password protection.

>Directions
After sending zmPW to your calculator and running Ion, you will be
prompted for a password. Press [MODE] to set a password or [ENTER] to
continue without a password. Ion will continue to prompt for a
password while zmPW is installed at Ion startup, shutdown, and when
you press [X,T,n] until you change the settings. To change your settings
enter your current password and press [MODE]. Now enter a new password.
Press [ENTER]. zmPW will now ask if you want it to require a password
on Ion startup. Press [1] if you do or [0] if you do not. Next zmPW
will ask if you want it to require a password to exit Ion.
Choose your password carefully. If you forget your password or type
it incorrectly you will have to reset your calculor (or resend zmPW
if you catch your error in time).
Using [MODE] in your password will not work!
You password may be up to eight keystrokes.
