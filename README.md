This is a collection of TI-83 and TI-83+ programs I wrote in Z80 assembly
language while in high school.  Most of these use the Ion shell, which runs
on both the TI-83 and TI-83+.

* BoxWorld - Game (SOS).
* Breakout - Breakout game with falling bonuses.
* Bytes - Snake game.
* Chip83 - Chip-8 emulator (SOS).
* Diamonds - A Breakout-like game with a twist.
* DStar - DStar game.
* Ion - A shell for running programs (needed for most programs here).
* Jezzball - Jezzball game.
* Landmine - Minesweeper-like game.
* Maze - Maze generator and game.
* Mem - Memory dump utility (TI-83+).
* Orbix - Orbix game, like Othello.
* SpaceWar - SpaceWar game.
* Tunnel - Tunnel game.
* zmPW - Password program for Ion.
