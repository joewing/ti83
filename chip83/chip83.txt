-----> Chip83 v0.1

This is a beta! That means it could have bugs still! Please alert me of
any bugs you find.

>Requirements
This is a TI-83 SOS program.
This program requires SOS v1.3+ with libraries ZLib and ZGFXL.

>Description
This is a Chip8 emulator for the TI-83.
Chip8 is a game programming language popular in the 1970s onward. It
is often associated with HP calculators. Chip8 looks similar to
assembly language, but it requires an emulator (or interpreter) to
run. Because of the unique instruction set, Chip8 makes writing games
easy while allowing the games to be very small as well.

>Keys
The menu screen will guide you through most of the keys.
The keys while running a program are:
[2nd] - Restarts the program
[MODE] - Pause the program and shut off the calculator.
[DEL] - Exit the program.
Keys for actual program usage are:
+---+---+---+---+
| X | X | X | / |
+---+---+---+---+
| 7 | 8 | 9 | * |
+---+---+---+---+
| 4 | 5 | 6 | - |
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | + |
+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | . |(-)| X |
+---+---+---+---+
Because Chip8 keys can vary, some of the keys may not be obvious.

If you find any Chip8 games that you are sure work, send them to me
to be converted into *.83p files.
