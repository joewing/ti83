>Requirements
A TI-83 or a TI-83 Plus with Ion.

>Installation
For the TI-83: Send landmine.83p to your calculator.
For the TI-83 Plus: Send landmine.8xp to your calculator.

>Object
The object of LandMine is to clear all the spaces that
do not contain a mine. When you uncover a space, a
number, a blank space, or a mine will appear. If you
get a space, then there is not a mine in any of the
surrounding 8 spaces. If you get a number, the number
indictes how many of the surrounding 8 spaces contain a
mine. If you get a mine, you loss!  You must complete
each level within 180 seconds.  The faster you do a
level, the more points you get. The first column does
not contain any mines to get you started.

>Keys:
Use the arrow keys to move.
[2nd] to uncover a space.
[ALPHA] to mark/unmark a mine.
[MODE] to shut down the calculator while the game is running.
[DEL] to exit.
