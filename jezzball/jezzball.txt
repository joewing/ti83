>Requirements
Requires a TI-83 or a TI-83 Plus with Ion.

>Installation
For the TI-83: Send jezzball.83p to your calculator.
For the TI-83 Plus: Send jezzball.8xp to your calculator.

>Object
The object of the game is to fill as much of the screen
as possible so that the ball(s) have a small area in
which to move around.  To do this you must draw lines
which fill the area of the screen that no balls exist
in if a side of the line does not contain any balls.  It
is complicated because your line moves slowly and if a
ball hits it while it is still drawing, you loss a life.
The score starts at 100 and ticks down as you play. If it
hits zero, you loose a life and start at 100 again.
Therefore the faster you fill the screen, the higher your
score!

>Usage
Use the arrow keys to move, [2nd] to start a line, [ALPHA]
to change the direction of the line that you can draw,
[MODE] to pause, and [DEL] to quit.
The menus should be self-explanitory except for the options
menu. Use [ALPHA] to change the speed and the arrow keys to
change the start level.
