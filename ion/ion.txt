See my home page (http://joewing.net) for more
information on Ion and Ion programming.

>Upgrade Note
If you are upgrading from Ion v1.0 or Ion v1.1 please
reset the RAM before installing this version. Do this
by selecting [2nd] [+] [7] [1] [2] (TI-83 Plus) or
[2nd] [+] [5] [1] [2] (TI-83).
You may want to save your programs before doing this.
This does not apply to those using Ion v1.2 or later.
If you do not follow these instructions, your
calculator will leak around 2k of RAM and may become
unstable.

>Background
Ion is a shell for both the TI-83 Plus and the TI-83.
It provides an efficient means for creating and using
programs on both calculators.

>Requirements
A TI-83 or TI-83 Plus.
A TI-Graph Link or equivalent.
 If you don't know what this is, you do not have
 one. This most likely did NOT come with your
 calculator.  See www.ti.com or some other calculator
 web site for more information.

>Installation
Send ion.8xg to your TI-83 Plus or
Send ion.83g to your TI-83.
To send to your calculator using the Graph-Link
software, select [Link|Send To|RAM] for the
TI-83 Plus or [Link|Send] for the TI-83.
Run prgmION.
Now run prgmA any time you want to run Ion. You
may delete prgmION and prgmIONZ if you like. However,
if you plan on sending Ion to someone else's
calculator, you must send those files to properly
install Ion.

>Description
Ion is an assembly language shell for the TI-83 and
the TI-83 Plus. Unlike other shells, this shell uses
a new relocation method that allows assembly language
programs to take advantage of all ROM calls, while
also allowing any program to run with less than 40
bytes of free memory. It also uses an improved
program format, which makes Ion programs smaller than
either AShell or SOS programs.
Here is a list of additional features:
	-Basic Shell Features
		-Allows any assembly language program
		 to be run with less than 40 bytes of
		 free memory.
		-Allows for modules, which allow one to
		 customize the Ion interface.
		-Automatically detects assembly language
		 programs.
		-Automatically moves programs to and
		 from Flash as needed (TI-83 Plus only).
		-Allows external levels to be stored in
		 Flash (TI-83 Plus only).
		-Contains a built in function library.
		-Program write-back.
		-Requires little memory.
	-Navigational Features
		-Allows for as many programs as your
		 calculator can hold!
		-Eight programs visible at a time.
		-Right/Left arrow keys allow you to easily
		 scroll through your programs.
	-Power Saving Features
		-Automatically powers down after a
		 minute or so of inactivity.
		-Uses little power while active.

>Keys
Run program:	[Y=] or [ENTER]
Move cursor:	[(up)] or [(down)]
Next list:	[(right)]
Previous list:	[(left)]
Exit Ion:	[MODE]

>Files
The following files are included in ion.8?g
-prgmION	The Ion installer
-prgmIONZ	Data file for the installer
-prgmZMINFO	Status bar module

>Notes/Troobleshooting
-Please read this entire file throughly before asking
 for help or submitting a bug!
-TI-83 and TI-83 Plus programs are not compatable at
 the binary level. You must send the correct program
 to your calculator if it is to work.
 TI-83 programs have the *.83p extension and
 TI-83 Plus programs have the *.8xp extension.
-Ion should say "Ion Installed!" after being run. If
 it does not, you probably do not have enough free
 memory.
-Although Ion can run programs from Flash (only on the
 TI-83 Plus, of course), it is recommended that you
 place the programs you use most often in RAM. There
 are two reasons for this: it is slower for Ion to swap
 between Flash and RAM every time a program is executed
 and it is not good for the Flash to be written to
 frequently. This isn't much to be concerned over, but
 it is good to keep in mind.
-Modules must be located in RAM to run.
-If a program that is stored in Flash refuses to run
 you probably do not have enough free RAM to execute it.
 Move some stuff out of RAM to make room for the program.
-If you get a message asking to do a garbage collect
 in Ion, always select "yes"
-External level files for most programs can be stored in
 Flash ROM (TI-83Plus). However, high scores etc, which
 may be stored with the external level, will be lost
 each time you exit the program or switch level sets.
-See http://joewing.calc.org for more information.

>Bugs
This version of Ion should be bug-free. Nevertheless,
there is always something I overlook!
Before reporting bugs please read this document fully!
Most "bug" reports I get are easily solved if only the
user would read this document! If you do not give me
enough information to find the problem your bug report
will be ignored. The more information the better.
Please email bug reports to joewing@calc.org with a
subject of "Ion Bug Report". Thank you!

>Misc Issues
It is unlikely that Ion will cause your calculator any
harm. However, I cannot be held responsible for any
damage to your calculator. Afterall, Ion is freeware!

>History
Non-public releases are not documented.
Project Started: 19990623
Version 1.0 <> 19990824
	TI-83 size: 	1746 bytes (less once installed)
	TI-83Plus size: 1801 bytes (less once installed)
	-First release!
Version 1.1 <> 19991009
	TI-83 size:	1741 bytes (1392 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1804 bytes (1546 once installed)
	-Fixed the bug that caused the TI-83 version to eat
	 memory if installed more than once.
	-Fixed the bug that caused the symbol table to
	 become corrupt.
	-Fixed the problem with ionFastCopy that caused the
	 screen to become garbled.
	-Now clears the graph screen on exit.
	-Fixed a bug in the TI-83 Plus version that caused
	 some crashes.
	-Fixed a bug in the TI-83 Plus version that caused
	 some programs to detect external levels incorrectly.
Version 1.2 <> 19991121
	TI-83 size:	1742 bytes (1420 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1795 bytes (1571 once installed)
	NOTE: This version is not compatible with previous
	      versions! Reset the RAM before installing by
	      selecting [2nd] [+] [7] [1] [2] installing.
	      You may want to save your programs first.
	-Fixed a bug that caused some crashes.
	-Added the ability to go to the previous list.
Version 1.3 <> 20000101 - Ring in the new year with Ion!
	TI-83 size:	1764 bytes (1431 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1783 bytes (1549 once installed)
	-Y2K OK
	-Major improvements to the module code. Forced
	 restart now works properly and reruns all
	 modules with keycode 1. Modules now run at the
	 proper location on the TI-83 (fixes some
	 crashes). Module detection number changed to
	 a two (all modules must be reassembled)!
	-Improved program detection code; fixes the
	 reinstall problems that occurred periodically.
Version 1.4 <> 20000103
	TI-83 size:	1592 bytes (1375 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1725 bytes (1491 once installed)
	-Fixed a bug in the TI-83 Plus module code.
	-Added another module event: program selection.
	 Program selection is code 2.
	-Now the bottom line of the Ion screen is blank
	 unless a module is installed. zmInfo, included
	 in ion.8xg and ion.83g, displays the
	 standard bottom line.
	-Compensated for a bug in the TI-83 Plus ROM
	 that caused running prgmA to have no effect
	 sometimes.
	-Optimized a little more.
Version 1.5 <> 20000519
	TI-83 size:	1535 bytes (1318 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1626 bytes (1392 once installed)
	-Improved the program loader. Now Ion is much
	 smaller and more stable.
	-Fixed a bug that sometimes caused problems
	 when running TI-83Plus archived programs.
	-Now external levels (for most programs) can
	 be used from Flash ROM (TI-83Plus). Note that
	 saving level data does not work when the
	 level is in Flash ROM.
Version 1.6 <> 20000617
	TI-83 size:	1529 bytes (1312 once installed)
	TI-83Plus size:	1630 bytes (1396 once installed)
	-Fixed the bug in the ionDetect library routine
	 which caused some programs to crash on the
	 TI-83 Plus. Unfortunately, this added to the
	 program size for the TI-83 Plus.
	-Shaved off a few bytes here and there.
	-The source code is now included.

	 information I needed to create Ion.
	-You, for using Ion!
	-All the people that encouraged me to finish
